This assignment was given to our class after a lecture in Hashing and Hash functions. 
I will be incorporating my own rendition of a Hash Map for this assignment.
The Hash Function I have decided to use for this is Linear Probing.
This method is rather simple and involves moving to the next index if there is a collision.

Problem: Develop a function that detects first non-repeating character in a string.
Use a hash-map with a hash function to incorporate this functionality.
