/* Question 2: (20 points)
How can you determine if a given tree is a Binary Tree or a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
Provide a C++ program to check whether the tree follows the BST properties, where for
each node:
• The left subtree contains only values less than the node's value.
• The right subtree contains only values greater than the node's value.
• The above conditions apply recursively to all subtrees.
The program should efficiently verify if the given tree is a valid BST and return an
appropriate result.  */
